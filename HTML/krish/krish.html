    <p style="color: black;">Ravindrasinh Anirudhsinh Jadeja (born 6 December 1988) is an Indian cricketer who represents the India national team currently in ODI and Test formats. 
       <br> He is an all-rounder, who bats left-handed and bowls left-arm orthodox spin. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest all-rounders and among the finest fielders of his generation.
        <br> He represents Saurashtra in domestic cricket and Rajasthan Royals in the Indian Premier League. Jadeja was a crucial member of the Indian teams that won the 2013 and 2025 ICC Champions Trophy, becoming leading wicket-taker and player of the final in the former and hitting the winning boundary in the latter final.
         <br> He was also a part of the Indian squad that won the 2024 ICC T20 World Cup, after which he announced his retirement from T20Is.
         Jadeja was vice-captain of the Indian U-19 cricket team that won the World Cup in Malaysia in 2008, under the captaincy of former Indian captain Virat Kohli.[3] He made his ODI debut against Sri Lanka on 8 February 2009 and scored an unbeaten 60 off 77 balls in that match. However, his Test debut came almost four years later, on 13 December 2012, against England at Nagpur.[4]</p>
